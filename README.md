# clickingtown
Clicking town is perfectly balanced clicker without exploits whatsoever.
Whole purpose of this project is to just have a sandbox project for tinker around Vue, to test some ideas. I decided to do something other than typical TODO app, because most of them didnt cover functionalities like routing.

Caution: May contains bugs.
